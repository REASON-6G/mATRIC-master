## How To Use It

You can clone this repository as is.

- Clone this repository manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/REASON-6G/mATRIC-master.git
```

- Enter into the new directory:

```bash
cd matric-master
```

- Push the code to your new repository:

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

### Update From the Original Repository

After cloning the repository, and after doing changes, you might want to get the latest changes from master.

- Make sure you added the original repository as a remote, you can check it with:

```bash
git remote -v

origin    https://github.com/REASON-6G/mATRIC-master.git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/REASON-6G/mATRIC-master.git (push)
```

- Pull the latest changes without merging:

```bash
git pull --no-commit upstream master
```

This will download the latest changes from master without committing them, that way you can check everything is right before committing.

- If there are conflicts, solve them in your editor.

- Once you are done, commit the changes:

```bash
git merge --continue
```

### Configure

You can then update configs in the `.env` files to customize your configurations.

Before deploying it, make sure you change at least the values for:

- `SECRET_KEY`
- `FIRST_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`

You can (and should) pass these as environment variables from secrets.

Read the [deployment.md](./deployment.md) docs for more details.

### Generate Secret Keys

Some environment variables in the `.env` file have a default value of `changethis`.

You have to change them with a secret key, to generate secret keys you can run the following command:

```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```

Copy the content and use that as password / secret key. And run that again to generate another secure key.
